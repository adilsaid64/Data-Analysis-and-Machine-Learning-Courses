# Data-Analysis-and-Machine-Learning-Courses
This is a showcase of what I've learned from university and from my own independent studies from online courses to textbooks. This includes tutorials, exercises and follow alongs from different professional data scientist and data analyst. The goal is to build up my knowledge, confidence, and experience to start doing my own  orignal projects using the skills I learn here. My aim is to work in data analysis/machine learning by mid-2022. 

This will include a mixture of Python and R code, with analysis.

Sometimes github doesnt render notebooks. So they can be seen via this link too: https://nbviewer.org/github/adilsaid64/
