# Data-Analysis-and-Machine-Learning-Courses
This is a showcase of what I've learned from university and from my own independent studies from online courses to textbooks. This includes tasks, tutorials and exercises. My aim is to work in data analysis/machine learning by mid-2022.

This will include a mixture of Python and R code, with analysis.
