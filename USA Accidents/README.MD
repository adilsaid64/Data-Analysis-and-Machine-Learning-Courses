The first data set I've performed exploratory analysis on. I've followed a walkthrough on youtube. The aim is to perform more walkthrough analyses to build the skills needed and apply them to my independent projects.
This was very beneficial and insightful to do in helping me get an idea of how to analyse a data set, ask interesting questions, and find out how to get answers.
