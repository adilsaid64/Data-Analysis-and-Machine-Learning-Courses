My second data analysis follow along course. I Analysed New York tree census data from 2015. However, I also applied the skills I had learned on how to perform data exploratory analysis and how to arrange your notebook from my previous work with the USA accidents project. 

From this project, I learned to improve my exploratory analysis. It has also increased my confidence in exploring data, asking questions, and going deep into the data. However, my biggest takeaway from this project was data cleaning. I learned different methods of cleaning data. Like, different ways on how to deal with NaN (missing values), and ways to deal with outliers in the data. I took notes in the notebook.
